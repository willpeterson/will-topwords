One day at a pie shop,
I met a man selling dresses,
For money he wanted to swap,
But I really wanted some jesses.

"Got any jesses?" asked I.
"For that's how I'll spend my money."
"No jesses here!" said the guy.
He seemed to find it quite funny.

"We've got some lovely bricks,
I'll give you a very fine price."
"I'd rather have some bolsheviks."
The man blinked rapidly thrice.

The man seemed exceptionally grumpy,
And his manner was strangely amused.
He wasn't what I would call clumpy,
Great disdain he noticeably oozed.

Like others, he thought I was odd,
Some say I'm a bit creepy.
Still he gave me a courteous nod,
As if he thought I was plenty weepy.

So in search of my goal I departed,
But before the pie shop could I leave,
The man came running full-hearted,
"I can help you I believe."

"Dresses, jesses, you shall find.
Bricks, bolsheviks, you can get.
You must now open your mind,
And get down to Barker's Market.

So to Barker's Market I decided to go,
In search of the jesses I craved.
The winds it did eerily blow.
But I felt that the day could be saved.

There were stalls selling shirts,
Shirts in many shades.
There were even stalls selling hurts
People were scattered from many trades

I was greeted by a peculiar lady,
She seemed to be rather creepy
I couldn't help thinking she might be quite shady.
I wondered if she was at all weepy.

Before I could open my mouth,
She shouted, "For you, I have some jesses!"
I headed towards her, to the south,
Past some bricks and dresses.

"But how did you know?" I asked,
"Do you want them or not?" she did say.
Silently, the jesses she passed.
Then vanished before I could pay.

As I walked away I hard a crackle
Or was it, perhaps, a hushed cackle?
