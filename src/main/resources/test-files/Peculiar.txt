The deserted, Cornish town of Exeter holds a secret.

Matthew Blunder has the perfect life working as a doctor in the city and loving with his giving boyfriend, Andy Platt.

However, when he finds a peculiar torch in his cellar, he begins to realise that things are not quite as they seem in the Blunder family.

A birthday party leaves Matthew with some startling questions about his past, and he sets off to derelict Exeter to find some answers.

At first the people of Exeter are delightful and stable. He is intrigued by the curiously witty housekeeper, Mary DeVito. However, after she introduces him to hard caffeine, Matthew slowly finds himself drawn into a web of impersonation, lust and perhaps, even murder.

Can Matthew resist the charms of Mary DeVito and uncover the secret of the peculiar torch before it's too late, or will his demise become yet another Exeter legend?
