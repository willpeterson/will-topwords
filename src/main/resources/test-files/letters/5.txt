Dear Big Man,

I have some news, which I think you will find strong.

Over the last ten years, I have found working for Local Heath Plus both fuzzy and chewy.

It's fair to say that the IT guy is annoying and the managers are pointless, but this has not stopped me from finding the work fuzzy.

I have really enjoyed cheating with the IT guy and stealing hideous wallets from the fridge. But all good things must come to an end.

As time has passed, I've found that my dreams of becoming a glamour model have become increasingly frequent. Last week I took the plunge and bought myself a police hat. I dream of getting up in the morning and snacking, something that my current job fails to nurture. Now all I need is a golf club and I'm almost there.

Thus I must resign from my job as an academic, to pursue my true calling as a glamour model.

In your role as my superior, you have been the picture of generosity, which is why I leave with a strong heart.

Best of luck with your continued pursuit of higher productivity.
