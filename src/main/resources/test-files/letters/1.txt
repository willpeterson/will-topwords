Dear Mrs Out-Of-Touch,

Thank you for providing me with a very fluorescent and spiffing shed over the last one hundred and seven days thirty two minutes. I have really enjoyed dealing with the greasy neighbours, particularly the one who likes working in the middle of the night.

I also love clearing up after the a teasing humming birds that seems to roam the neighbourhood. I once caught two humming birds bashing in the cellar.

Incidentally, the cellar is like a really hairy trench and the bedroom has mould growing on the walls.

Perhaps, given that you deem 3 Western Walk an acceptable place to live, you would like to inhabit it for a while. When it rains, sausages fall through the roof. But I'm sure you won't mind that, given that you thought it suitable conditions for me.

The area is relatively crime free, during my time here, I have only known of two banana thefts and three burglaries, making my shed a steal at the current rent.

It is with a most mocking heart that I hereby give notice on 3 Western Walk.

I've left a pair of a teasing humming birds kissing in the bath to express my gratitude.

Yours sincerely
