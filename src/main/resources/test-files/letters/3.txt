Dear Micheal Gove,

I am a member of the Conservative party. I have always found your party's politics somewhat greasy and your individual views rather tasteless. I believe in the values of free speech and honesty.

Your sense of humour is manky and your hair, little.

Recently, I have come to feel troubled about affordable housing. I am affected by this most days because I love animals.

During your time as a politician, you have spoken out against crime and argued in favour of care for the elderly. I hope you will rise to the challenge and put an end to violent video games.

I am writing you to ask that you cut your hair and also, hopefully stop telling lies. Don't let your yummy relationship with Micheal Gove stand in the way of progress.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know where you stand on this issue and if you are able to help with my request.

Thank you for taking time to read my letter, oh manky one.

Dr Love
