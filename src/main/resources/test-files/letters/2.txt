Dear Bane of My Life,

Thank you for providing me with a very entertaining and mild flat over the last three years. I have really enjoyed dealing with the crazy neighbours, particularly the one who likes singing in the middle of the night.

I also love clearing up after the an ugly guppies that seems to roam the neighbourhood. I once caught two guppies prancing in the pantry.

Incidentally, the pantry is like a really hairy pub toilet and the cellar has mould growing on the walls.

Perhaps, given that you deem 10 Autumn Avenue an acceptable place to live, you would like to inhabit it for a while. When it hails, roof tiles fall through the roof. But I'm sure you won't mind that, given that you thought it suitable conditions for me.

The area is relatively crime free, during my time here, I have only known of two murders and three thefts, making my flat a steal at the current rent.

It is with a most slippery heart that I hereby give notice on 10 Autumn Avenue.

I've left a pair of an ugly guppies skipping in the bath to express my gratitude.

Yours sincerely
Looking4Love
