Dear Mr Wilson,

I am sorry to report that little Maddie has been assigned a detention.

As you know, little Maddie is usually a very stunning and aggressive child. However, today I caught him spinning during class.

When I asked him to stop, he shouted, "D'oh!" and began prancing with his friend Rachel.

Maddie aggravated the matter further by calling me a grubby maggot and likening my cheeks to a pointless radish.

Little Maddie was also in violation of the school uniform policy. I do not allow terrifying hair extensions at Little Clam Pre-School.

Little Clam Pre-School prides itself on being a crazy and baggy establishment. Thus we simply cannot have children spinning and prancing on the premises. Added to which, my cheeks looks nothing like a radish, as Mrs Simpson will testify.

Please ensure that little Maddie attends detention tomorrow after school, and leaves his terrifying clothing at home.

Yours sincerely
Mad4It
